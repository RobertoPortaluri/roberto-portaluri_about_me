👋🏻Hi! I am a Front End developer with 2 years of experience.

◎ABOUT ME◎

I am a sports lover ⚽️ and a video game enthusiast 🎮,
From an early age I had the passion and dedication to everything related to technology 📱, hoping that one day I could have the opportunity to make it my job📂.

Now, I am a proud contributor to BitRocket.dev🚀, and am constantly updating and developing to increase my skills🔮.
